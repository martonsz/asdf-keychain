## Running the scripts directly

The plugin scripts are driven by environment variables, so each one can be run
on its own without asdf. The `sandbox` directory is a scratch area for this; its
contents are git-ignored and the scripts create the directories they need, so
there is nothing to set up first.

```shell
# List the installable versions
./bin/list-all

# Resolve the latest stable version
./bin/latest-stable ""

# Download 3.0.4 into sandbox/download
ASDF_INSTALL_VERSION=3.0.4 \
  ASDF_DOWNLOAD_PATH=./sandbox/download \
  ./bin/download

# Install what the previous step downloaded, into sandbox/install/bin.
# bin/install never downloads; it only copies from ASDF_DOWNLOAD_PATH, so the
# download above has to have succeeded and use the same path.
ASDF_INSTALL_TYPE=version \
  ASDF_INSTALL_VERSION=3.0.4 \
  ASDF_DOWNLOAD_PATH=./sandbox/download \
  ASDF_INSTALL_PATH=./sandbox/install \
  ./bin/install

# Check what was installed
./sandbox/install/bin/keychain version

# Start over
rm -rf sandbox/download sandbox/install
```

## Testing with asdf

```shell
asdf plugin test <plugin-name> <plugin-url> [--asdf-tool-version <version>] [--asdf-plugin-gitref <git-ref>] [test-command*]

asdf plugin test keychain https://github.com/martonsz/asdf-keychain.git "keychain version"
```

To test the working copy rather than the pushed repo, add the plugin from a
local path:

```shell
asdf plugin add keychain "$PWD"
asdf install keychain 3.0.4
asdf plugin remove keychain
```

Tests are automatically run in GitHub Actions on push and PR.

## Running the workflows locally with act

[act](https://github.com/nektos/act) runs the GitHub Actions workflows locally:

```shell
act -j lint
act -j plugin_test
```

On an Apple Silicon Mac the defaults do not work. Put these flags in `.actrc`
in the repository root (the file is git-ignored, so it stays local):

```text
--container-architecture linux/amd64
--container-daemon-socket=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

`--container-architecture linux/amd64` is needed because the runner images act
uses are amd64 only.

`--container-daemon-socket -` turns off mounting the Docker socket into the job
container. This is likely specific to Rancher Desktop: its socket lives on the
macOS side at `~/.rd/docker.sock` and the Linux VM cannot bind-mount it, so the
job fails with `operation not supported`. Docker Desktop may not need this flag.

Rancher Desktop on macOS also requires `DOCKER_HOST` to be set, because it does
not use `/var/run/docker.sock`:

```shell
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://$HOME/.rd/docker.sock"
```

That matters doubly here: act uses the container daemon socket to find the
daemon as well as to mount it, so with `--container-daemon-socket -` it falls
back to `/var/run/docker.sock` and cannot connect unless `DOCKER_HOST` says
otherwise.

Two things to expect when running `plugin_test`: act skips the `macos-latest`
leg of the matrix, and `asdf plugin test` clones the plugin from GitHub rather
than from the working copy, so it tests the pushed branch.
